# Data Analysis

Data analysis in machine learning refers to the process of examining, cleaning, and transforming data in order to prepare it for use in training a machine learning model. This can include tasks such as identifying missing or incorrect data, removing outliers, and transforming the data into a format that can be used by a machine learning algorithm. The goal of data analysis is to ensure that the model is trained on high-quality, representative data that will allow it to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.
